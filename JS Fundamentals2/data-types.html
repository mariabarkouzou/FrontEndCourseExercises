          The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.
          There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division
          /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.<br />Besides regular numbers,
          there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this
          data type: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.

          <br />Infinity represents the mathematical Infinity ∞. It is a special
          value that’s greater than any number.<br />NaN represents a
          computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined
          mathematical operation.

      <tr>
        <td>BigInt</td>
        <td>
          In JavaScript, the “number” type cannot represent integer values
          larger than (253-1) (that’s 9007199254740991), or less than -(253-1)
          for negatives. It’s a technical limitation caused by their internal
          representation.

          <br />For most purposes that’s quite enough, but sometimes we need
          really big numbers, e.g. for cryptography or microsecond-precision
          timestamps.

          <br />
          BigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers
          of arbitrary length. A BigInt value is created by appending n to the
          end of an integer:

        <td>
          A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.<br />In
          JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.

          <br />
          Double quotes: "Hello". <br />Single quotes: 'Hello'. <br />Backticks:
          `Hello`. <br />Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s
          practically no difference between them in JavaScript.

          <br />Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to
          embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Boolean (logical type)</td>
        <td>
          The boolean type has only two values: true and false. This type is
          commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and
          false means “no, incorrect”.

        <td><a href="https://javascript.info/">View</a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>The "null" value</td>
        <td>
          The special null value does not belong to any of the types described
          above.

          <br />It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null
          value.<br />In JavaScript, null is not a “reference to a non-existing
          object” or a “null pointer” like in some other languages.

          <br />It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or
          “value unknown”.

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>The "undefined" value</td>
        <td>
          The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its
          own, just like null.

          <br />The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.

          <br />If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is
          undefined.

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Objects & Symbols</td>
        <td>
          The object type is special.

          <br />All other types are called “primitive” because their values can
          contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever).
          In contrast, objects are used to store collections of data and more
          complex entities.

          <br />Being that important, objects deserve a special treatment.
          <br />The symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for
          objects.

      <tr>
        <td>The typeof operator</td>
        <td>
          The typeof operator returns the type of the argument. It’s useful when
          we want to process values of different types differently or just want
          to do a quick check.

          <br />
          It supports two forms of syntax:

          <br />
          As an operator: typeof x. <br />As a function: typeof(x). <br />
          In other words, it works with parentheses or without them. The result
          is the same.

          <br />The call to typeof x returns a string with the type name.
