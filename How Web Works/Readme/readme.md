It took me 8 hours to finish the site and 4 hours for the Debugging!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I had an issue with the Design of the page(not the css code but the form I wanted for the website) but I quickly found a solution due to my creativity.
The most tiring part was the Debugging process.I found solution searching through the internet for similar errors in the code and I corrected the mistakes.
